    * Sample a ''k''-combination from a population of ''n''.
    *
    * This algorithm uses a linear congruential pseudorandom number generator (see Knuth)
    * to perform reservoir sampling via "''Algorithm R''".
    *
    * It is ~ '''''O'''''('''''n''''').
    *
    * If `n` â‰¤ `k`, then return 0, ..., `n` - 1; otherwise, if `k` < `n`, the
    * returned array have length `k` with values between 0 and `n - 1` (inclusive)
    * but it is '''NOT''' guaranteed to be sorted.
    *
    * '''NOTE''': This is a pure function.  It produces the same results as if
    * `java.util.Random` was used to perform reservoir sampling but since it doesn't
    * carry state, this can be trivially operated in parallel with no locking or CAS
    * loop overhead.  The consequence is that the `seed` must be provided on every call
    * and a new seed will be returned as part of the output.
    *
    * To get this function to act like `java.util.Random`, the first time it is called, the
    * seed should be produce by running the desired seed through `initSeedScramble`.  For
    * instance:
    *
    * {{{
    * val (kComb1, newSeed1) = sampleCombination(4, 2, initSeedScramble(0))
    * val (kComb2, newSeed2) = sampleCombination(4, 2, newSeed1)
    * }}}
    *
